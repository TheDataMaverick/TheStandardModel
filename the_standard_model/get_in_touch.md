# Get in touch

If anything, **and I do mean anything**, is unclear, please reach out either via an [issue](https://github.com/TheDataMaverick/TheStandardModel/issues), by [tagging](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/CETJLH1V3/p1684844381972109) me on the [dbt Slack community](https://www.getdbt.com/community/join-the-community/), or by sending me an email at [martin@imus.dk](mailto:martin@imus.dk).

If you think something could be improved, let’s discuss it on the [dbt Slack community](https://www.getdbt.com/community/join-the-community/), just write your suggestion and [tag me](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/CETJLH1V3/p1684844381972109). 🙏

If 10,000 developers use The Standard Model as a basis for their data platform, the smallest improvement can really make a difference in people's lives! So be a hero, please comment. 🦸‍♂️
